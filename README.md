# SQL_using_python

I dedicated time and effort to complete a comprehensive Python tutorial with Mosh on YouTube, totaling nearly 6 hours. Covering all the basic to advanced topics, I crafted a simple SQLite3 program for testing. I invite you to review my code and make any modifications or suggestions. Thank you for your support and guidance in my learning journey! ❤️
